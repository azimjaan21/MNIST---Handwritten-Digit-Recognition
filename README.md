**Handwritten Digit Recognition using k-NN**

This project implements a Handwritten Digit Recognition system using the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) classification algorithm. The model is trained and tested on the well-known MNIST dataset, which contains 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9). The goal is to classify the digits accurately based on their pixel values.

**Project Overview**

In this project, we:

Loaded and explored the MNIST dataset.
Preprocessed the images by normalizing pixel values and splitting the data into training and test sets.
Implemented the k-NN classification algorithm using scikit-learn.
Evaluated the model using accuracy, confusion matrices, and classification reports.
Tuned the hyperparameters to optimize the performance of the k-NN classifier.
