# MNIST---Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
Handwritten Digit Recognition using k-NN  | This project implements a handwritten digit classification system using the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm on the MNIST dataset. It involves data preprocessing, model implementation, and hyperparameter tuning to achieve high accuracy in digit prediction.
